# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
Hello Readers!
    
    We have developed a simple hand written digit recognition system using the fundamental Machine Learning Algorithms.We tried to do something new with our project by making it interactive with the users.There was only one way to do that -By building an User Interface.
All the user has to do is draw a digit which ranges from 0 to 9 and click on the predict button in the right hand side,and the result would be displayed below.The UI was developed using Python's Tkinter and some other techniques were used to save the state like Pickle.
    
    This was all about the UI, behind the scenes of our project were the algorithms of Machine Learning and Image Processing.In this project we built a classifier based Digit Recognition System,since it was our first working project involving Machine Learning,so we decided to take it step by step maintaning the simplicity and understandability for everyone. We used some of the most basic classifiers like KNN and Decision Tree to the most accurate classifiers like the Support Vector Machine for prediction.The training and test sets were provided by MNIST.
    
    The details of our project has been written in a research-like paper which has been attached in our repository.Those who wish to see how we achieved building this model can read and explore in there.
    
    Since this was our first step in Machine Learning we built a classifier based model.We will be working on a better and more accurate model which will involve the use of Artificial Neural Networks.Till then,do mail us your suggestions and questions in tge contact info provided.
